## Short Bio

I am Chunyang Wang 「王春阳」, an Incoming Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) supervised by Dr. [Gege Wen](https://gegewen.github.io/). I obtained my MSc degree in [Applied Computational Scince and Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/applied-computational-science/) from Imperial College London (under the supervision of Dr. [Stephan Kramer](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.kramer) and Prof. [Matthew Piggott](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.d.piggott)) and my BEng in Computer Science and Information Technology from  [Southwest University](http://admissions.swu.edu.cn/About/SWU.htm).

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning for Science:** I am interested in utilizing machine learning techniques to empower the scientific discovery process, particularly through the use of neural networks to develop surrogate models that accelerate scientific computation.
- **Computational Methods:** Includes applying Finite Element Methods (FEM) and Finite Difference Methods (FDM) to carry out physical simulations.

## News

- **[Feb. 2024]** I was awarded a Janet Watson PhD
Studentship and will be starting my Ph.D project in Sep. 2024 at Imperial College London.
- **[Nov. 2023]** I obtained my MSc degree from Imperial College London with Distinctin.
